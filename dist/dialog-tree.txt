2 Hi

2
Sorry if this is weird, but, do you think I'm cute?
4 Yes
3 No

3
Oh, sorry for wasting your time.
0 [ Try another beeble ]

4
You say "yes," but I say "no" :(
3 I guess you're right.
5 Noooo stop. You can't say that about yourself.

5
You say "stop," but I say "go, go, go"
6 You know, I gotta "go, go, go" myself, see you later.
8 You are so totally cute. Geoff has nothing on you.

6
We just started talking, I don't know why you say "goodbye," I say "hello" ;)
0 Goodbye
7 Fair enough

7
Right, where was I...?
5 I said to stop being hard on yourself

8
Geoff? You've gotta be joking. He's the real heartthrob of the Beebles.
9 Nah, cat ears really aren't my thing.
3 Yeah, I guess you're right, I guess I should be talking with him.
10 Idk, sounds like you like him...

9
Haha yeah. And can you imagine all the hairballs he gets?
11 Haha, Pete, you're so funny.
12 What? I don't get what you mean.

10
WHAT? No! I would never! Ok, maybe he is a little cute.
11 Not as cute as you :P
13 Agreed.

11
You really think so? Thanks, I think you're pretty groovy too. Gotta go though. Let's talk again sometime.
0 Bye

12 
Hairballs, you know, because he's a cat? I guess it's not that funny.
0 I'm allergic to cats.

13
Well, at least that's something we have in common. Gotta go, for now though.
0 Bye Pete!

14
Quick, tell me your favorite fruit!
15 Apple
16 Tangerine
17 Strawberry

15
Not a bad choice. Sounds like a great name for a record label.
18 For sure.

16
Oh, I love Cream Tangerine candies! My favorite is the Savoy Truffle.
18 Me too!
19 Gross, I hate fruit candies.

17
I oughta take you down to the strawberry fields then! Plenty there to pick!
18 Sounds like a date!
19 My parents were killed by a strawberry.

18
Haha, great. So what's on your mind?
20 I was actually just about to send you some fanmail.
22 I was wondering if you we're dating anyone...

19
Eh, maybe we're not really a match then...
0 Maybe not.

20
I'm warning you with peace and love, but any fanmail you send me after the 20th of October is gonna be tossed.
21 Seriously?
19 You can't stop me, I'm sending it no matter what.

21
Yep. With peace and love, I've got too much to do.
23 Alright.

22
Well, I get by with a little help from my friends...
27 Haha, Richard, could I be your friend then?

23
You know where I'd like to be?
24 Where?
24 No idea.
19 At the post office?

24
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopuses garden, in the shade.
19 Eh, idk, do octopuses have gardens?
25 You could take a yellow submarine!

25
Haha you've got it.
26 Do I have you impressed?

26
It don't come easy, but you're far out. Let's talk again sometime. Peace and love.
0 Ok! Bye.

27
We'll have to find out.
23 How so?
