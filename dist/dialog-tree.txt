2 Hi

2
Sorry if this is weird, but, do you think I'm cute?
4 Yes
3 No

3
Oh, sorry for wasting your time.
0 [ Try another beeble ]

4
You say "yes," but I say "no" :(
3 I guess you're right.
5 Noooo stop. You can't say that about yourself.

5
You say "stop," but I say "go, go, go"
6 You know, I gotta "go, go, go" myself, see you later.
8 You are so totally cute. Geoff has nothing on you.

6
We just started talking, I don't know why you say "goodbye," I say "hello" ;)
0 Goodbye
7 Fair enough

7
Right, where was I...?
5 I said to stop being hard on yourself

8
Geoff? You've gotta be joking. He's the real heartthrob of the Beebles.
9 Nah, cat ears really aren't my thing.
3 Yeah, I guess you're right, I guess I should be talking with him.
10 Idk, sounds like you like him...

9
Haha yeah. And can you imagine all the hairballs he gets?
11 Haha, Pete, you're so funny.
12 What? I don't get what you mean.

10
WHAT? No! I would never! Ok, maybe he is a little cute.
11 Not as cute as you :P
13 Agreed.

11
You really think so? Thanks, I think you're pretty groovy too. Gotta go though. Let's talk again sometime.
0 Bye

12 
Hairballs, you know, because he's a cat? I guess it's not that funny.
0 I'm allergic to cats.

13
Well, at least that's something we have in common. Gotta go, for now though.
0 Bye Pete!

14
Quick, tell me your favorite fruit!
15 Apple
16 Tangerine
17 Strawberry

15
Not a bad choice. Sounds like a great name for a record label.
18 For sure.

16
Oh, I love Cream Tangerine candies! My favorite is the Savoy Truffle.
18 Me too!
19 Gross, I hate fruit candies.

17
I oughta take you down to the strawberry fields then! Plenty there to pick!
18 Sounds like a date!
19 My parents were killed by a strawberry.

18
Haha, great. So what's on your mind?
20 I was actually just about to send you some fanmail.
22 I was wondering if you we're dating anyone...

19
Eh, maybe we're not really a match then...
0 Maybe not.

20
I'm warning you with peace and love, but any fanmail you send me after the 20th of October is gonna be tossed.
21 Seriously?
19 You can't stop me, I'm sending it no matter what.

21
Yep. With peace and love, I've got too much to do.
23 Alright.

22
Well, I get by with a little help from my friends...
27 Haha, Richard, could I be your friend then?

23
You know where I'd like to be?
24 Where?
24 No idea.
19 At the post office?

24
I'd like to be under the sea, in an octopuses garden, in the shade.
19 Eh, idk, do octopuses have gardens?
25 You could take a yellow submarine!

25
Haha you've got it.
26 Do I have you impressed?

26
It don't come easy, but you're far out. Let's talk again sometime. Peace and love.
0 Ok! Bye.

27
We'll have to find out.
23 How so?

28
Well? What do you want?
0 Nothing. My bad, sorry.
29 Pete said he had a crush on you.
32 I can't believe John and Pete won't let you put your songs on an album.

29
Pete? You're joking right? Pete is way too cute to be into me.
30 Yeah, haha, I was just kidding.
41 No, for real, he told me.

30
Ah, fair enough.
0 Bye

31
Really? You know, I don't want to admit it, but I kinda like him too. Thanks for telling me.
0 Any time.

32
I can't believe it either. Makes my guitar gently weep.
34 That's really poetic, you know that?
33 Ugh, I can see why they don't let you have any songs.

33
Well, who asked you anyways?
0 Bye
29 Pete likes you though, you know.

34
What can I say, I'm a poetic guy.
35 Out of curiosity, who is your favorite Beeble?

35
Who is yours?
36 John
37 Pete
38 You
39 Richard

36
Well, yeah, he is pretty popular, I can agree with you there
40 Anyways, I gotta go.

37
Ugh yeah. Pete is really cute, but he thinks I'm too boring.
29 No way, Pete said he liked you!
40 Really? Well, I gotta go.

38
Wow, that's flattering, but let's be serious now.
36 John
37 Pete
39 Richard

39
Yeah, Rich can always make me laugh.
40 True, I think I'm gonna go talk with him.

40
Well, nice talking with you.
0 Bye

41
No way. I don't believe you.
31 He loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
30 Yeah, you got me. Just kidding.

42
Well hello, hello.
45 Hi John
43 Goodbye

43
Leaving already? What did I do?
44 Nothing, I was just kidding.
0 You're just not my type.

44
Haha, well you got me.

46
Haha, not just anybody, right?
49 You got it. >w<
50 Well, I was actually kinda hoping for Richard.

47
Fair enough, the life of a Beebles fan must be exhausting
51 You have no idea.

48
I, uhh... Ok.
0 Anthology 2 [Disc 2]

49
Well, I'll have to see what I can do. You're pretty cute, you know?
52 I don't really think so.
53 You really think so?

50
Yeah, I get that, he is quite the ladies man. You should go talk to him.
0 Ok!

51
I feel you. Some people call me lazy when I'm Only Sleeping. You better get some rest.
0 [ pass out from exhaustion ]

52
Well, you are. I gotta run though. Nice talking.
0 Bye

53
Haha, of course. Almost as cute as Pete.
54 Wait, Pete?
57 McLemon shipping? Gross

54
Yeah, I mean, he is the cute one after all, I'm afraid even you can't compete with that.
55 I thought we had something special?
56 Yeah, he is pretty cute actually. I think I'll go talk to him.

55
Haha, not that special, I'm afraid.
0 Ouch

56
Good idea. Tell him I said hi.
